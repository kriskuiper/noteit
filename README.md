> 📝 Notion-like clone to learn SvelteKit for a bit and improve my front-end skills.

## Prerequisites

I run this application using Node v18.12 but you probably can run it on 16 something too. If you don't have v16 or v18 installed but do use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) just run:

```bash
nvm use <version>
```

## Installation

Before developing you should install the dependencies using either `yarn` or `npm`.

```bash
yarn install
```

## Developing

You can spin up a development server at [localhost:5173](localhost:5173) by running `yarn dev` or `npm run dev`.
